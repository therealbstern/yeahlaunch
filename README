New in 0.3:

yeahlaunch will now read a configuration file named .yeahlaunchrc in your
home directory.  The format is:

name=value

where lines that begin with a dash (-) are treated as command-line arguments
and everything else becomes a button title.

If you want a different configuration for different invocations (multihead,
different positions on the screen, etc.), you can pass -c on the command
line to read an alternate configuration file.  (Using -c in the config file
does nothing, though.)

Here's an example of my .yeahlaunchrc:

-x=600
-bg=blue
Firefox=firefox
    =/bin/false
VMWare=/usr/bin/vmplayer
    =/bin/false
OpenOffice=/opt/openoffice.org/program/soffice
Writer=/opt/openoffice.org/program/swriter
Calc=/opt/openoffice.org/program/scalc
Math=/opt/openoffice.org/program/smath
Base=/opt/openoffice.org/program/sbase
Impress=/opt/openoffice.org/program/simpress
Printers=/opt/openoffice.org/program/spadmin
    =/bin/false
XSane=/usr/bin/xsane
XFig=/usr/bin/xfig

The blanks act as spacers between "program groups."


New in 0.2:

The menu entry is highlighted when clicked (see -afg below).
Rightclicking launches command and hides yeahlaunch instantly.
New placement option -rx to which yeahlaunch will be placed right aligned.
Specify -rx "your screen width" and yeahlaunch will be right aligned to the
top right corner of your screen.
Leaving yeahlaunch sideways hides it as well now.

Yeahlaunch is a very simple application launcher which puts a horizontal menu
on top of your screen. The menu will be hidden and only a one pixel border will
be visible. If you point on that border the menu will be shown in an animated 
way.
Yeahlaunch has the fllowing options:
-fg color     foreground color (defaults to white)
-afg color    highlight  color (defaults to yellow)
-bg color     background color (defaults to black)
-x  number    x placement (defaults to 0)
-step number  step size for the animation(defaults to 3)
-fn font name (defaults to fixed)
-h  prints help message
all other options on the command line are recognized in the following way:
label command (label = string that is displayed, command = command to execute)
this means you have to specify here something ...
If a command contains spaces or a "-" you have to use quotes, see example
below.
This is what I have in my .xinitrc:

~/yeah/yeahlaunch/yeahlaunch -fn "*-aqui-*" -x 700 -fg "light steel blue" \
TVtime tvtime \
Opera opera \
Firefox firefox \
NEdit nedit \
Gimp "gimp-2.0" \
"  " "" \
Home rox  \
Yeah "rox ~/yeah" \
Vertikal "rox ~/vertikal" &

Installation is done by a simple make;make install
